# Project 1: YouTube Clone using only HTML/CSS
Developed a fully responsive YouTube clone website from scratch using my knowledge of HTML and CSS. Utilized key concepts such as the CSS box model, grid and flexbox layouts, positioning properties, display properties, and other advanced techniques to create an engaging user experience. This project not only helped me solidify my understanding of front-end development fundamentals but also showcased my ability to work independently on complex projects.
